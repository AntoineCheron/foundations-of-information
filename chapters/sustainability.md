I grew up near Portland, Oregon in the 1980's and 1990's. At the time, and even more so now, it was a place where the environment was front and center in daily life. Recycling was mandatory, with steep fines for not properly sorting cans and bottles, or placing something recyclable in the garbage. Community gardens were everywhere, with prominent public composting piles and vibrant collections of neighborhood greens. My public primary school taught us native perspectives on relationships to nature, detailed histories of overfishing of northwest salmon, and depicted our fragile human existence as protected by a thin layer of ozone, protecting us from the sun's radiant ultraviolet light. Bicycles were everywhere, I regularly saw cars that ran on biofuel, and most school field trips involved hiking into the woods to literally hug trees, thanking them for absorbing the dangerous carbon dioxide we emitted with every breath.

And yet, as I entered graduate school, and begin to attend academic conferences, I did not think twice about my trips around the world. In just six years of study, I flew from Pittsburgh to Florida, Rhode Island, San Francisco, Austria, New Zealand, Italy, China, the United Kingdom, Alberta, British Columbia California, Missouri, Germany, Nebraska, Colorado, India, Massachusetts, Georgia, Switzerland, and back home to Portland at least twelve times. Despite all of the cans, bottles and paper I recycled, all of the lights I diligently kept off, all of the trees I planted, all of the buses I rode, and all of the donations I'd made to saving fish and rain forests, in those six or so flights per year, my family's carbon output went from an already very high 15 tons of CO2 per year (mostly from our use of inefficient natural gas radiators and driving), to _40_ tons of C02. There simply was no feedback about my behavior on global warming.

These two stories show how entangled climate change is with information: the press and education shapes our understanding of long term consequences; feedback and energy policy about our actions shapes our future behavior; and as we inevitably face the increase in frequency and severity of global warming crises, information will be ever more central in helping humanity respond to crisis and survive.

# The Science of Climate Change

- Use the climate change slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/16q5GbQRarNq4QXH1KknMiJyncdToI7MsLiANWjN-iZQ/edit#slide=id.g3cd5ceaff2_0_157
- As we noted, science produces highly certain information
- Origins of the science
- Skepticism came from oil companies
- Oil companies have changed their minds
- All that’s left is conspiracy

# Feedback on Behavior

- Breakdown of consumption
- Includes growing contributions by data centers
- Poor ability to predict consumption
- Many ties to information (DiSalvo, C., Sengers, P., & Brynjarsdóttir, H. (2010, April). Mapping the landscape of sustainable HCI. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on human factors in computing systems (pp. 1975-1984).)
- Persuasive technology (The design of eco-feedback technology, Jon Froehlich, Leah Findlater, James Landay)
- Ambient awareness
- Sustainabile interaction design
- Pervasive and participatory sensing
- Limits of persuasion 
(Defines sustainability too narrowly on the individual, granting authority to designer, technical solutions ot social problems; Brynjarsdottir, H., Håkansson, M., Pierce, J., Baumer, E., DiSalvo, C., & Sengers, P.
